# Clustering
The original dataset "data2.txt" contains 5000 2D coordinate points, and is normalized to generate "normalized_data.txt".  
We tried three clustering methods, all of which were implemented using python standard library. The methods we implemented are agnes, kmeans and gmm, in which agnes was optimized by heapq, and "agnes_lod.py" was the script before optimization.
